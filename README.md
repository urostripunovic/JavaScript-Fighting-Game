# 2D Fighting Game ⚔

A simple 2D fighting made in JS/HTML and some CSS with object oriented programming in mind. Spirte animations, local CO-OP, simple fighting game logic and an AI (not the neural network kind) to boot were done in this project.

### Known Bugs

- ~~Can't run outside of the map or at the edge of the map~~
- ~~Double jumps or multiple jumps outside of the map~~
- Swiping multiple times by holding in `space`/`ArrowDown` (It's a feature) ❌
- Animation bugs where longer animations can't be canceled before the determine winner is done i.e player with longer animations don't "*die*"
---
##### TODO:
- Simple bot AI.
- Start buttons to start the battle against bot or local CO-OP
- Pick between Ninja and Fantasy Man to go against (If I feel like it, sprites are already implemented)
- Reverse the sprites when they run past each other (Can't since the sprites don't come with that) ❌
- Win streaks (Wasn't able to make it work as I wanted. trying to count up in a infinity loop isn't a great idea) ❌
